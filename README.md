# Challenge6

This is a simple version of the server with a simple UI. It runs using 4 threads, 2 for the server I/O and 2 for a Users I/O.
I don't know why, but the elements in the Jframe don't appear, you will have to hover over buttons and click in the textboxes.

In the frame you will first need to enter your name. You can disconnect by typing /Exit
